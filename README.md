# multi-agent-travel-planner
A modular multi-agent system for planning travel itineraries using python code
Here’s a sample README file for a project called Multi-Agent Travel Planner, tailored for clarity, recruiter impact, and technical depth. You can adapt it for GitHub or portfolio use:

🧭 Multi-Agent Travel Planner
A modular AI-powered travel planning system that uses multiple agents to collaboratively generate optimized itineraries based on user preferences, budget, and constraints. Designed for scalability, explainability, and real-world deployment.
🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how autonomous agents can work together to solve complex planning tasks. Each agent specializes in a subdomain—flights, hotels, activities, budget, and constraints—and communicates via a shared memory or messaging protocol to build a coherent travel plan.
🧠 Architecture
- User Interface Agent: Accepts user input (destination, dates, budget, preferences).
- Flight Agent: Finds and ranks flight options using APIs or mock data.
- Hotel Agent: Suggests accommodations based on location, budget, and ratings.
- Activity Agent: Curates local attractions, events, and experiences.
- Budget Agent: Tracks total cost and flags overruns.
- Coordinator Agent: Orchestrates communication and resolves conflicts.
Agents use a shared context or message-passing system (e.g., LangChain, FastAPI, or custom protocol) to collaborate.
🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI or Flask (for agent endpoints)
- LangChain or custom agent framework
- OpenAI or HuggingFace models (for reasoning)
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
- Optional: Streamlit or Gradio for UI
📦 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-travel-planner.git
cd multi-agent-travel-planner
pip install -r requirements.txt


🧪 Usage
python main.py


Then visit http://localhost:8000 to interact with the planner.
🧩 Example Input
{
  "destination": "Paris",
  "dates": ["2025-08-10", "2025-08-15"],
  "budget": 1500,
  "preferences": ["art museums", "local cuisine", "walkable areas"]
}


📚 Features
